ubuntu_anki_update
==================

Downloads and updates anki packages automatically

Designed to work in Ubuntu 14.04. 
Run `sudo python ./ankiupdate.py' to match currently installed anki version and download/install the latest version if not available. 

This is a quick workaround to the lack of a proper ppa to keep anki up-to-date.
